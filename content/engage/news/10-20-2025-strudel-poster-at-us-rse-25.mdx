Members of the STRUDEL team recently presented a timely poster at the 3rd annual US-RSE conference in Philadelphia, PA. This poster fostered discussions about the use of generative AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, CoPilot, Cline) when working to build usable web application user interfaces and also in daily work. The team undertook this work with the aim of assessing the extent to which generative AI provides RSEs an opportunity to create scientific web GUIs from simple prompts, without needing formal web development skills.

The poster can be found in the conference proceedings: <a href=" https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17295878" target="_blank"> https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17295878</a>. 

This exploratory work informed the materials for STRUDEL’s October 2025 workshop.
