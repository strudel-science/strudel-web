The STRUDEL team hosted a lively, all-day workshop with over thirty participants prototyping web applications using the STRUDEL Design System and AI assistants. This valuable opportunity enabled participants and the STRUDEL team to explore the usefulness of generative AI tooling alongside colleagues from a range of disciplines. The majority of participants had little-to-no experience with the tools backing the STRUDEL Design System templates (React, TypeScript), yet with the help of AI assistants, were able to generate impressive prototypes that continued to follow design patterns embedded in the STRUDEL Design System.

Design Systems like STRUDEL are resources that enable teams to design and build consistently usable, scalable experiences with common components, patterns, and guidelines. The STRUDEL Design System incorporates components and patterns into code templates so that research software teams can rapidly deploy usable front-ends for their scientific applications.

Attendees were grateful to the STRUDEL team for their work organizing the event and all felt like they were able to dig into a variety of topics during the day. The prototypes that participants were able to generate represent real problems throughout various scientific domains, from astrophysics to genomics, energy technologies, water quality, and particle accelerators. The prototypes individuals developed may continue beyond the workshop and have an impact on scientific discovery and operations in a range of environments.

***“I just want to express my gratitude for such an awesome day today. The workshop was really well structured and facilitated, and I learned a lot. Thank you so much for letting me come!”***

This workshop helped continue to validate the utility of the STRUDEL Design System and templates. The prototypes built during the workshop exemplify how this design system enables users to jumpstart their scientific UIs with a usable starting point, while also giving them the freedom to customize templates. Many participants were able to go from application concept to interactive prototype in the same day.

The STRUDEL team facilitated the workshop in cooperation with our multi-organization partnership funded by the Sloan Foundation. To provide an environment for prototyping with STRUDEL kit our colleagues at 2i2c configured a dedicated environment pre-configured with everything an end user needs to begin prototyping from their browser. Key to this was a partnership between STRUDEL lead developer Cody O’Donnell and 2i2c to test and configure the Cline VS Code extension along with OpenRouter to provide access to a wide range of cutting edge models for coding. This ensured that workshop participants could select among a range of models, even swapping over the day to test performance and features, while working in an environment optimized for prototyping with STRUDEL Design System.

***“Having a startup environment was very nice, as often getting a good development environment set up is half the battle for smaller projects.”***

The STRUDEL team supplemented the dedicated environment and AI tooling with a cheatsheet of AI tips and tricks, including suggested prompts. These insights are available in the <a href="https://strudel.science/strudel-kit/docs/usage-with-ai" target="_blank"> STRUDEL documentation </a> for all to use. Contributions with additional tips and tricks can be made by opening an issue in the STRUDEL GitHub.
