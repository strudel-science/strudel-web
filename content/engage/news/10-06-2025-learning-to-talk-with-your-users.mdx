The STRUDEL team hosted a highly interactive in-person workshop at the <a href="https://us-rse.org/usrse25/program/" target="_blank">US-RSE 2025 Conference</a> in Philadelphia, providing research software engineers with hands-on training in conducting semi-structured user interviews. 

Semi-structured interviews allow for the collection of rich, qualitative data on users' experiences, perspectives, values, and challenges. These interviews help gather actionable feedback and guide future development priorities so that research software products can improve usability.

The workshop was structured to cover three key areas: recruitment and protocol development, conducting interviews, and data analysis. Through a combination of presentations, interactive exercises, and group discussions, participants gained practical experience and knowledge in designing and executing effective semi-structured interviews. To support continued learning, attendees received reusable resources for future reference.

With over 50 participants in attendance, the workshop was a resounding success, offering valuable instruction and sparking lively engagement. The high level of interest and curiosity among attendees was evident, with requests to learn more about user research and also to reuse the workshop structure and materials. 

Overall, the workshop equipped research engineers with the skills and confidence to integrate semi-structured user interviews into their own research and software practices.
