<h2 id="sec-us-rse-wg">Join the US-RSE UX Working Group</h2>

We invite you to join the US-RSE User Experience (UX) Working Group (UXWG). This working group advocates for increased awareness and adoption of UX methods in research software engineering. The STRUDEL team regularly joins these monthly meetings.

Working group members have a variety of backgrounds and professional roles. During meetings, they share knowledge, experiences, and challenges and to foster a diverse and inclusive community for research software UX practitioners and research software engineers (RSEs) who are interested in UX. Doing so will collectively help us advocate for and demystify UX to the larger RSE community, scientists across domains, and funding agency staff who support products and services.
