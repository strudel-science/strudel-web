The STRUDEL team is excited to host community members at an all day, in person event at Berkeley Lab on October 23, 2025 (anticipated 9am-5pm). <i>Light breakfast, lunch, and snacks will be provided along with opportunities to network with a range of community members.</i>

Spend the day prototyping a web app with STRUDEL Design System for your scientific software to address new user needs. You’ll join a community of user-focused research software engineers working to build better research software, explore how AI can accelerate the creation of usable scientific tools, and contribute improvements to the open source STRUDEL Design System. By the end of the day, you’ll walk away with skills to more rapidly build high-quality, user-friendly web interfaces; a working prototype; and valuable professional connections.

We intend for this to be a full day of hands-on coding and testing with colleagues from an array of scientific domains. We will be using VSCode, STRUDEL Design System built on React, and AI assistants. Interest or awareness of these tools is encouraged but not required for those eager to engage in hands-on learning!

STRUDEL will be providing light breakfast, lunch, and snacks throughout the day. Please be certain of your availability when registering so that we can plan appropriately. We will follow up with confirmation closer to the event.

STRUDEL also has a limited amount of funding to support some participant travel. Please answer the question below if you will require funds. Exact amounts are TBD based on interest and availability.

Space is limited, so be sure to register now via the <b><a href="https://go.lbl.gov/strudelOct25" target="_blank">registration form</a>  by Oct 3rd, 2025 </b>.
<br/><br/>We’re excited to see you there!

## Who Should Join

This workshop is for research software engineers, scientists, and students who want to build or improve scientific web applications. <b>Participants are encouraged to bring their own scientific projects to prototype during the workshop</b>

Whether you’re tackling usability challenges in an existing project, exploring generative AI for development, building your portfolio, or contributing to open source and open science, you’ll gain practical skills, a functional prototype, and a community of collaborators. 

You’ll get the most out of this workshop if you:

- Are eager to explore coding assistants and AI agents for UI design and development.
- Are curious about building web applications.
- Have basic familiarity with the command line, modular code, and programming concepts.
- Have basic familiarity with at least one Integrated Development Environment, we will be using VSCode throughout the workshop
- Want to create a functional app prototype


## Why Join?

- Learn how to rapidly prototype a scientific web application using the STRUDEL Design System
- Learn practical ways to integrate generative AI tools into your development workflow
- Learn techniques to improve usability and user experience in research software
- Learn how to work with research-based templates to speed up development
- Network and collaborate with research community working on different user problems
- Get expert feedback and support on improving your science applications and development workflows
- Showcase your work to the world and add a project to your portfolio showcase
