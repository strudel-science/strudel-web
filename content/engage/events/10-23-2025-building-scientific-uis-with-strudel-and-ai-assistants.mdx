The STRUDEL team is excited to host an in person community event at Berkeley Lab on October 23, 2025.

Spend the day (anticipated 9am-5pm) prototyping a web app with STRUDEL Design System for your scientific software to address new user needs. You’ll join a community of user-focused research software engineers to address real user needs, explore how AI can accelerate the creation of usable scientific tools, and contribute to improving the open source STRUDEL Design System. By the end of the day, you’ll walk away with skills to rapidly build high-quality, user-friendly web interfaces; a working prototype; and valuable professional connections.

<b><i>We’ll keep you fueled with snacks and lunch, and may be able to help with travel — just let us know in your registration so we can plan for you.</i></b>
<br/>
Space is limited, so be sure to register now via the <b><a href="https://forms.gle/9sWsFTSWp8zVzyLSA" target="_blank">registration form</a></b> with <b>code 'strudelWeb25'</b> by Oct 3rd, 2025. <br/>We’re excited to see you there!

## Who Should Join

This workshop is for research software engineers, scientists, and students who want to build or improve scientific web applications. 

Whether you’re tackling usability challenges in an existing project, exploring generative AI for development, building your portfolio, or contributing to open source and open science, you’ll gain practical skills, a functional prototype, and a community of collaborators. 

You’ll get the most out of this workshop if you:

- Are curious about building web applications.
- Have basic familiarity with the command line, modular code, and programming concepts.
- Have basic familiarity with at least one Integrated Development Environment, we will be using VSCode throughout the workshop
- (Optional) Have some experience with web development — it is helpful, but not required.
- Are eager to explore coding assistants and AI agents for UI design and development.
- Want to create a functional app prototype


## Why Join?

- Learn how to rapidly prototype a scientific web application using the STRUDEL Design System
- Learn practical ways to integrate generative AI tools into your development workflow
- Learn techniques to improve usability and user experience in research software
- Learn how to work with research-based templates to speed up development
- Network and collaborate with research community working on different user problems
- Get expert feedback and support on improving your science applications and development workflows
- Showcase your work to the world and add a project to your portfolio showcase
