The STRUDEL team is excited to host an in person community event at Berkeley Lab on October 23, 2025.

Spend the day (anticipated 9am-5pm) prototyping a web app with STRUDEL Design System for your scientific software to address new user needs. You’ll join a community of user-focused research software engineers to address real user needs, explore how AI can accelerate the creation of usable scientific tools, and contribute to improving the open source STRUDEL Design System. By the end of the day, you’ll walk away with a working prototype, skills to rapidly build high-quality, user-friendly web interfaces and valuable connections.


<b><i>We’ll keep you fueled with snacks and lunch, and may be able to help with travel — just let us know in your registration so we can plan for you.</i></b>
<br/><br/>
<b>Space is limited, so be sure to register now via the [registration form](https://forms.gle/9sWsFTSWp8zVzyLSA) by Oct 3rd, 2025. <br/>We’re excited to see you there!</b>
<br/><br/>
### Who Should Join

This workshop is for research software engineers, scientists, and students who want to build or improve scientific web applications. 

Whether you’re tackling usability challenges in an existing project, exploring generative AI for development, building your portfolio, or contributing to open source and open science, you’ll gain practical skills, a functional prototype, and a community of collaborators. 

<b><i>You don’t need to be a web development expert — just bring your curiosity and a basic awareness of tools like GitHub Copilot, VS Code, and Node.js.</i></b>
