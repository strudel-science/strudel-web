## The STRUDEL Open Source Effort

STRUDEL is an open source community building resources to enable more usable scientific software. Our mission is advocating for and advancing the inclusion of user experience (UX) practices & tools in scientific software development.

STRUDEL stewards multiple key products. Our scientific Design System provides adaptable user interface patterns with <a href="https://strudel.science/design-system/task-flows/overview/" target="_blank">interface templates</a>, <a href="https://github.com/strudel-science/strudel-kit" target="_blank">reusable code</a>, and <a href="https://strudel.science/strudel-kit/docs/" target="_blank">documentation</a>. The open <a href="https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/rapid-usability-tutorial/" target="_blank">curriculum</a>   develops educational resources to help a wide range of stakeholders learn how to conduct user experience activities as part of their scientific software development. You can learn more on our website https://strudel.science/
