The STRUDEL team is excited to host an in person event at the US-RSE 2025 conference on October 23, 2025.

This workshop will provide practical instruction on a common technique for user research: semi-structured interviews. Semi-structured interviews are a flexible method for gathering rich information about experiences, perspectives, values, and challenges that can be used to improve research software products. 

Workshop participants will learn about recruitment, protocol development, and analysis and will leave the workshop with reusable resources for future use. Through this training, research software engineers will gain confidence in identifying user requirements and experience issues, gathering actionable feedback, and prioritizing future development directions.
