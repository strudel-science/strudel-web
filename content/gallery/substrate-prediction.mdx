This is a minimal web app prototype built during STRUDEL AI workshop, that lets users input a chemical name or SMILES ID and instantly receive predictions from a pre-trained ML model. Inspired by the CATNIP interface, this tool bridges cheminformatics and machine learning to explore molecular data in a user-friendly and browser based way.
