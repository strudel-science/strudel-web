This prototype enables users to easily extract and analyze a Building Energy Conservation Measure (ECM) report and data. Users can upload a PDF containing ECM information, review and edit the extracted markdown, and see it transformed into structured data right in the interface. A built‑in AI assistant helps analyze ECM details, including costs, savings, and tailored recommendations.
