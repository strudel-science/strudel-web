This prototype provides an interactive web interface for exploring live beamline data — including devices, plans, and detector images. The prototype initially used mock data to fine‑tune table formatting, then progressed to real API calls from locally hosted servers. The site integrates APIs from the [Bluesky](https://blueskyproject.io/) experimental python library,  which is in use at the ALS and also various DOE labs.
Using STRUDEL’s “compare data” and “explore data” task flows as the foundation, the prototype gained intuitive features like filters and charts, resulting in a more polished and user-friendly interface.
