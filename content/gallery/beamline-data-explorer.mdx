This prototype lets users explore live beamline data about devices, plans and also detector images in an interactive web interface. The project began with mock data to refine table formatting, then moved to real API calls from locally hosted servers. 
Using STRUDEL’s “compare data” and “explore data” task flows as the foundation, the prototype gained intuitive features like filters and charts, resulting in a more polished and user-friendly interface.
