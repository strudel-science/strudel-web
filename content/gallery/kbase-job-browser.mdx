A web app designed for monitoring KBase Narrative jobs and exploring complex data like ontologies, taxonomies, and other nested structures. It uses live data from the JobBrowserBFF API, with the monitoring features built on the “monitor‑activities” task flow, and introduces a proposed new task flow for navigating hierarchical datasets.
