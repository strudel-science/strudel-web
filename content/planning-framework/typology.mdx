## Not Another Best Practices Blog Post

Forget generic advice or industry oriented solutions. By characterizing your project needs with the STRUDEL Typology, STRUDEL Bot offers you advice on UX work and project planning that is actually relevant to your team, your budget, and your science. When you try STRUDEL Bot, expect it to ask you questions and deliver customized advice.

The STRUDEL Typology is a conceptual tool for categorizing elements of scientific projects building and using software products. Developed through qualitative research and literature reviews, the typology helps identify and compare common activities in scientific work that should be considered when focusing on requirements, user experience, software sustainability, and so on for software. The focus on software production and use, especially its UX and sustainability, is a key distinction and bias of the STRUDEL Typology. Three interconnected elements shape this typology:

Organizational issues - The bounding, bedrock contexts shaping work at hand

Social concerns - The dynamics of people arranged into teams doing work

Technical matters - The details shaping software product(s) and affecting a user's experience

STRUDEL Bot will ask you about relevant components of this typology so you can find the right solution. Learn more about the STRUDEL Typology by <Link to="https://escholarship.org/content/qt9g27k0h8/qt9g27k0h8.pdf" target="_blank">reading our report</Link>.
